## Features
- **Metric Picker**: Switch dynamically between different review metrics, including Overall Rating, Cabin Staff Service, Entertainment, Food & Beverages, Ground Service, Seat Comfort, and Value for Money.  
- **Interactive Filters**: Narrow down results using multiple filters:  
  - **Date filter** (continuous monthly timeline slider)  
  - **Seat Type** (Business, Economy, First Class, Premium Economy)  
  - **Traveler Type** (Business, Couple, Family, Solo Leisure)
  - **Aircraft type** (All aircraft above 50 reviews, under 50 reviews grouped to "various")  
  - **Continent** (mapped from country dataset for regional insights)  
- **Geographic Map**: Visualize average ratings by country with color coding, coastlines, and continent-level filtering.  
- **Monthly Trends**: Line chart showing changes in selected metrics over time, helping identify patterns and shifts across years.  
- **Aircraft Breakdown**: Bar chart comparing average ratings across aircraft models, paired with number of reviews for context.  
- **Summary Metrics**: Key performance indicators displayed at the top (average ratings across all categories).  
- **Cross-filtering Dashboards**: Each visual can act as a filter — for example, clicking on a country, aircraft, or month instantly updates all other charts.
